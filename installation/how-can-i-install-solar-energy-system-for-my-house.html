          <br />
          <h2>Finding Best Location</h2>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The most recommendation is to position solar panels facing
            <strong>south</strong>. As we are located in the northern
            hemisphere, the sun is always along the southern part of the sky as
            it completes its annual orbit.  
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Apart from the direction of the panels, the angle of placement is
            also important.
            <strong>
              This angle depends on the position of your roof and is almost
              equal to the latitude of your house.</strong
            >
            This angle allows sunlight to hit the panels at right angles and
            generates a high amount of energy. It also makes it easier for snow
            to slide off the panels in winter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The roof can also be a self-sloping roof, there are different
            mounting methods to optimally place the solar panels.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            For the majority of property owners in the US, the ideal angle for a
            solar panel installation is between<strong>
              30 degrees and 45 degrees</strong
            >, close to or equal to the latitude of your home (on a south-facing
            roof).
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Mounting Panel On Roof</h2>
          <br />
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            "Many solar panels, come with mounting brackets that you can simply
            attach to your platform. For steel platforms or roofs, you will need
            a good drill. If your panels didn't come with brackets, ask the
            manufacturers if they can be provided or where the best place to get
            them is. Also, ask how to attach the brackets to your solar panels.
            When you are ready to install, first secure the front legs of the
            brackets. Make sure they are perfectly square and centered before
            securing them with screws or other mounting materials. Once you have
            meteorological data to determine the Sun's movements in your area,
            it's time to attach the rear legs. By the way, I realize that the
            Earth moves, not the Sun, but bear with me for the sake of these
            instructions."

          <br />
          <h2>Wiring</h2>
          <br />
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            "You will need a junction connector or a fuse combiner box. You will
            need to connect the solar panels to the conduit. The wires of the
            panels must be stripped and wired in pairs before being connected to
            the fuse box mounted on the platform. The stripped wire should be
            connected to the terminal box. The red wires are connected to the
            positive terminal and the black wires are connected to the negative
            terminal. After connection, the wires are fed under the junction box
            and reconnected to the respective positive and negative terminal
            blocks."
